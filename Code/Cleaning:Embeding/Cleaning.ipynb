    "This part focuses on text processing and analysis. Your tasks include:\n",
    " \n",
    "1. Preprocess your Text Corpus. You can use your own data or the clean data we provided during practical exercise :\n",
    "   - Perform cleaning and normalization.\n",
    " \n",
    "2. Compute TF-IDF Weights:\n",
    "   - Calculate the TF-IDF weights for each word.\n",
    " \n",
    "3. Word Vectorization:\n",
    "   - Use a pre-trained Word2Vec model for vectorizing words (e.g., from [http://nlp.polytechnique.fr/word2vec#french]).If you canâ€™t access to nlp polytechnique models, you can use https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/ models or you can train your own Word2vec model like we did during the session\n",

    "4. Create Sentence Vectors:\n",
    "   - Form sentence vectors using the weighted average of word vectors based on TF-IDF weights.\n",
    " \n",
    "5. Write an Analytical Report:\n",
    "   - Analyze the representation quality and discuss the impact of TF-IDF weighting."
